# Who am I?
## I'm John.

I'm currently employed by Amazon Web Services (AWS) working as a Cloud Support engineer in the containers team specialising in services like EKS, ECS ECR and Fargate. At AWS, I provide technical support to Business and Enterprise support plan customers, along with troubleshooting issues, and replicating production environments to deliver solutions. I previously worked as a DevOps intern at Cylynt for six months in 2022. 

I studied a BSc (Honours) Computing degree at the National College of Ireland with an upper 2.1 grade. 

I'm self-teaching myself Japanese with a love for Japanese culture, food and the language. I'm aiming high and want to achieve N1 at some point. I also host a Japanese-English language exchange meet-up every Sunday. 

I'm very passionate about all areas of I.T, including software development, DevOps, cloud infrastructure, systems architecture and more. I enjoy expanding my technical, problem-solving and skills in the I.T industry.
