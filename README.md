# Who am I?
I'm John.
I'm a third-year student studying a BSc (Honours) Computing degree at National College of Ireland. 
I'm self-teaching myself a secondary language which is Japanese and hope to pass N5 level at the end of year.
I love software development, I have a big passion for development in iOS/Mac. 
I'm currently building an iOS text adventure game 
using technologies in Swift 5.5, Core Data, GIT and more and hope to have a release in November 2021.


# Interests
## Futher Software Development
I like to go outside what I know. I want to learn about technologies in machine learning, artificial intelligence and more. 
I believe in always learning new things. I would also like to learn about game-development and strictly make games as a hobby. 
I plan to use Unreal Engine 5 and learn C++ to make games. 
## Language Learning 
As mentioned, I am currently undergoing language learning in Japanese, I enjoy Japanese culture and the language 
and would love to talk directly with Japanese people
